There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > workout.log()

## Sub-Heading ##
  > This product is for individuals who would like to keep track of their daily caloric intake and expenditure.

## Summary ##
  > workout.log() is a calorie tracker app that takes in to account the user's desired daily calorie goal, their fitness activity and their calorie consumption. Our proprietary algorithm calculates their net calories. The user is able to submit multiple logs throughout the day for each activity (food or exercise) and the tracker will increment or decrement their remaining calories. This product is useful for users attempting to gain or lose weight by allowing them to log and visualize their activities and allow them to adjust throughout the day.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  > Estimating and keeping track of caloric intake and expenditure off the top of your head throughout the day is very difficult and often leads to inaccurate measurements.

## Solution ##
  > workout.log() eliminates the guesswork. Our product will keep all of a user's activity in one central location to be referenced and added to throughout the day.

## Quote from You ##
  > "workout.log() aims to benefit everybody from hardcore fitness enthusiasts to individuals just wanting to live a healthier lifestyle." - Jordan Hoang, CEO, CTO, CFO, President, Founder, Intern

## How to Get Started ##
  > Getting started is super easy! Just create an account, submit your activities, and let workout.log() keep track of what daily net calories.


## Customer Quote ##
  > workout.log() has changed my life! Before, I was just trying to estimate my calories and was way off actual numbers. Now I can keep track of everything I do. Thanks workout.log()!
